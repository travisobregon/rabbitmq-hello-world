# Running the programs

To begin, make sure you have [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/platform) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html) installed.

Open two terminals.

Run the consumer:

```
cd Receive
dotnet run
```

Then run the producer:

```
cd Send
dotnet run
```
